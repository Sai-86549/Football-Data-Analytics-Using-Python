# FIFA World Cup Data Analysis

This project aims to perform data scraping and analysis of FIFA World Cup data to visualize match fixtures, clean the data, create a dream team, and predict the winner of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

## Overview

The project consists of the following key steps:

1. **Data Scraping**:
   - Extracted FIFA World Cup data from the official Wikipedia page using Python and the Pandas library.
   - Utilized Beautiful Soup in PyCharm to parse and modify the scraped data, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the extracted data in a Jupyter Notebook.
   - Addressed missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Employed Python's data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visualizations.
   - Visualized FIFA World Cup match fixtures, team performance, and historical trends.

4. **Dream Team Creation**:
   - Analyzed player statistics and performance data to build a "dream team" for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
   - Considered key metrics and player attributes to select the ideal lineup.

5. **Winner Prediction**:
   - Utilized historical data and predictive modeling techniques to forecast the winner of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
   - Employed machine learning algorithms or statistical methods for prediction.

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the FIFA World Cup data files, including fixtures and matches data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook files detailing data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and prediction.
- `visualizations/`: Stores generated data visualizations and plots.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
